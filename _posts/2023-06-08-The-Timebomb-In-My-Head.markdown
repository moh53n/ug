For years different psychiatrists and psychologists made different comments about my mental stage, but most of them agreed that a 2-3 year part of my life showed strong evidence of psychosis, probably schizophrenia.
Yet, I feel like those symptoms (at least the positive ones) got better, and maybe, it wasn't schizophrenia at all, although my negative symptoms got worse after I was arrested in October.
But it scares me, the possibility of having a bomb in my head, ready. I kind of feel it inside my head, sometimes whispering to me...
