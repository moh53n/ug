Today my best friend has left Iran for good. I'm happy for her because she rescued her life by leaving Iran in her early 20s, but I'm also sad for (partially) losing a good friend, knowing many more of my friends will leave Iran later this year.    
Eventually, most of the intelligent and helpful people will immigrate from here to form a new life, and some people like me will be stuck here due to political exit bans, essential military service, feel of guilt, etc.    
When I was a kid, I was fascinated with the idea of living in a post-apocalyptic region like the fallout world, but in the end, I wanted to be a successful person living in a good place. I never thought that someday I'd be stuck in a place that would be like a post-apocalyptic region soon.    
So here I am, stuck in Iran, hopeless, soon to be alone with mullahs.
